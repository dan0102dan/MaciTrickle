/* Subscription list fetch — port of subscriptions/fetch.go's FetchList.
 * Uses libcurl (dependencies.md: "TLS is non-negotiable for https
 * subscription URLs and hand-rolling TLS is out of the question").
 *
 * Replicates Go's exact redirect semantics via libcurl's URL API +
 * FOLLOWLOCATION off, not libcurl's own automatic redirect handling
 * (which follows more status codes and doesn't cap identically):
 * - only HTTP 301/302 are followed as redirects; any other 3xx is
 *   treated as a plain non-2xx terminal failure (a real Go quirk, kept
 *   deliberately -- 303/307/308 are NOT special-cased);
 * - at most MT_SUB_FETCH_MAX_REDIRECTS hops, loop detection against
 *   every URL visited so far (including the original);
 * - only http/https schemes with a non-empty host are accepted, at the
 *   original URL and at every redirect target.
 *
 * mt_sub_fetch_list's MT_SUB_FETCH_MAX_BODY_BYTES cap is C-side hardening
 * (dependencies.md's "size bound") -- Go's io.ReadAll has no such limit.
 * No real subscription list approaches this size; it exists only to
 * bound memory against a hostile or misbehaving server.
